## [Unreleased]

### Breaking — wire format / SDK shape

- **SDK: `EventFilter.route` removed.** `EventFilter` no longer carries a
  route filter. Bus subscribers should match on `source` / `type` and
  filter by `matched_routes` from `EventRecord` (`RouteRef[]`).
- **JSONL `route` is now an object.** File loggers emit `route: { module,
  name }` instead of a bare string. Downstream consumers parsing
  `~/.orgloop/logs/orgloop.log` must read the new object shape.
- **OTel route attributes renamed.** The single `orgloop.route` attribute
  is replaced by two scalar attributes — `orgloop.route.name` and
  `orgloop.route.module`. Object attributes are not valid OTel values, so
  this is a hard rename.
- **Prometheus metric labels gain `module`.** Both
  `orgloop_events_routed_total` and `orgloop_event_processing_seconds`
  now carry a `module` label alongside `route`. Existing dashboards must
  group/aggregate by `(route, module)` instead of `route` alone.
- **Syslog SD parameters `route` → `route.name` / `route.module`.**
  RFC 5424 structured data now carries the two parameters.

### Added

- `RouteRef` identity primitive in `@orgloop/sdk` (`{ module, name }`)
  with helpers `routeRefKey`, `formatRouteRef`, `routeRefEquals`.
- `RouteStatsStore` per-module stats container (replaces the runtime-wide
  route stats map).
- `EventProcessor` extraction — the event pipeline now lives on its own
  class, not inline on `Runtime`.
- `HandlerBundle` registration contract on `WebhookServer`. Runtime
  control endpoints (load/unload/reload/status/shutdown) and CLI-level
  handlers (`/api/doctor`, `/control/module/load-project`) all register
  via the bundle path. REST and inbox APIs are migrated; their legacy
  `registerRestApi` / `registerInboxApi` helpers are retained as
  deprecated thin shims that delegate to the bundle path.
- `compileWithCanonicalAjv` / `getCanonicalAjv` — single Ajv authority in
  `@orgloop/core/schema`. The CLI no longer instantiates Ajv directly.
- Plugin registrations now declare `kind` and `description`; CLI
  `init` derives scaffold YAML from the connector's own `setup.scaffold`
  metadata instead of hardcoded templates.
- CLI route resolver (`packages/cli/src/route-resolver.ts`) for `orgloop
  logs --route` — resolves bare names via live `/api/routes` or JSONL
  scan, with cross-module ambiguity warnings.
- CI step `sync-plugin-catalog` enforcing kind/description on every
  registration and a single workspace Ajv instantiation.
